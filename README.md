this is a little thingy i made in 2 hours. basically for ascend math users who are tired of the shitty basecamp (g.myascendmath.com/Ascend/basecamp.htm) they can now play eaglercraft inside. get's past most tracking systems and still makes you look like your on the page (because u are, it's just an iframe). so uh, yea. this is subject to update. all you have to do is grab this script, throw it into tampermonkey, save it, then go to g.myascendmath.com/Ascend/basecamp.htm specifically (subject to change) and press ALT+e and boom, ur in. there is an exit button to the top right corner that closes it. the scroll bars are  slight issue but will be fixed. console messages will also be silenced. this will probably be turned into an extension soon.
