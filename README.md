open calculator whenever with ALt + Q. alt and e i think opens eaglercraft in basecamp. the rest is just buttons and backround things. i'll compile these into one script eventually but rn i'm not doing that.  

upcoming thigs:

game library instead of just eaglercraft (WIP)
auto answer (WIP)
ui overhaul (WIP)
