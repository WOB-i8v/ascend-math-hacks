open calculator whenever with ALt + Q. alt and alt + e opens eaglercraft in basecamp. alt + w opens the font changer. alt + r opens the player customizer. the rest is just buttons and backround things. i'll compile these into one script eventually but rn i'm not doing that.  

upcoming thigs:

game library instead of just eaglercraft (WIP)
auto answer (WIP)
ui overhaul (WIP)
general optiizations/qol stuff (WIP)
unlimited coins (not a WIP)
idk i'll think of more things :)
