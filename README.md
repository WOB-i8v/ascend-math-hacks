ALt + s opens calculator.
alt + w opens the font changer.
alt + r opens the player customizer.
Alt+ z sends you to basecamp, ALt + x sends you to studyguide/start lesson, and Alt + c sends you to the menu.

the rest is just buttons and backround things. i'll compile these into one script eventually but rn i'm not doing that.  

upcoming thigs:

game library instead of just eaglercraft (WIP)
auto answer (WIP)
ui overhaul (WIP)
general optiizations/qol stuff (WIP)
unlimited coins (not a WIP)
idk i'll think of more things :)

NOTES:
the eaglercraft file dissapeared and my laptop is being laggy as shit with it. for now it is gone but it will be back.
sorry :(
