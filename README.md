skipper 1 and 2 give you the answer to normal and multi choice questions. HOWEVER they do not work right on the post assesments due to higher security. i do have a working multi choice answer snatcher for post 
assesments 

but i want to release it with it's varient. that is proving to be tricky since the data isn't sent by the server. anotherwords, imma have to set up a redirect or middleman server of some sort connected to an API for best results :/
The rest is just buttons and backround things. i'll compile these into one script eventually but rn i'm not doing that.

this whole repository will be undergoing an update shortly.


UPCOMING THINGS:
game library instead of just eaglercraft (WIP)

auto answer (Almost done!)

ui overhaul (WIP)

general optiizations/qol stuff (WIP)

unlimited coins (not a WIP)

skipper 1 and 2 for post assesment (WIP)


NOTES:

the eaglercraft file dissapeared and my laptop is being laggy as shit with it. for now it is gone but it will be back.
